					<h2>Invitation</h2>
					<p>
						You are kindly invited to Katerina's 30th birthday
						celebration. Join us for a picnic lunch by the lake of
						Revine in northern Italy on Saturday, June 1st.
						Festivities will begin at midday. Feel free to bring
						along your favorite food, drinks, and games to share!
						Accommodation is available for those wishing to stay
						overnight. We have two houses reserved: one near the
						lake (ideal for one-night stays) and another higher up
						in the forest (suitable for multiple-night stays). In
						case of rain, the forest house will be the location of
						the picnic. It features a spacious garden, a lovely
						half-covered outdoor space, and a large dining room for
						our gathering. Please let me know your accommodation
						preference and arrival details in advance. On June 2nd,
						after the celebration, we can explore the surroundings
						together—whether it's a leisurely walk around the lake,
						visiting the old town, or enjoying any other activities
						that we decide on together.
